## Track Your Matches

Spike Stats displays your recent **Valorant matches** in an easy-to-swipe layout organized by game modes.

> All your matches are permanently recorded and neatly categorized by season & act in the [Matches Archive](/features/matches-archive).

## Swipe Between Game Modes

- Swipe between **Unrated**, **Competitive**, **Swiftplay**, **Spike Rush**, **Deathmatch**, **Escalation** and **Team Deathmatch** game modes.
- Each tab displays your matches in a chronological list that includes:
  - **Match outcome** (Victory/Defeat)
  - **Round score** (e.g., 13–7)
  - **KDA summary** (Kills / Deaths / Assists)

Tapping a match takes you to its detailed breakdown in the [Match Details](/features/match-analysis) page.
