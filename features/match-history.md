The match history screen in Spike Stats provides an intuitive and interactive way to review your recent Valorant games — complete with performance graphs and filtering options.

## 🕹️ Track Your Latest 200 Matches

Spike Stats displays your **most recent 200 Valorant matches** in an easy-to-swipe layout organized by game modes.

> Looking for older matches? Don’t worry — you can find all of them in the [Match Archive](/features/match-archive).

## 🎮 Swipe Between Game Modes

- Game mode tabs are located at the bottom of the screen.

  - **Round score** (e.g., 13–7)
  - **KDA summary** (Kills / Deaths / Assists)

Tapping a match takes you to its detailed breakdown in the [Match Details](/features/match-analysis) screen.

## 📈 Performance Graphs That Respond

- The top of the screen displays a **graph that updates dynamically** as you change game modes.
- Every match is represented as a **dot on the graph**.
