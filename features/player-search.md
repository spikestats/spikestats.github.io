# Valorant Player Search

Spike Stats makes it easy to look up **Valorant player’s profile and view their stats in seconds**, as long as their profile is public.

## Find Valorant Players by Riot ID

To search for a player, simply enter:
- Their **game name**
- Their **tagline** (e.g. #EUW, #NA1)
- Their **platform** (PC or Console)

## What You Can See in a Searched Profile

Once found, the player’s public stats are shown, including:
- Match history
- Agent and weapon stats
- Performance overview
- Competitive rank and more

This allows you to:
- Check out friends’ stats
- Scout your rivals
- Analyze top-performing players

## Save Players to Favorites

Searched players can be added to your **Favorites List**, so you can revisit their profile anytime without needing to re-enter their game name and tagline.

This makes it easy to keep track of friends, teammates, or streamers you follow.
