# Valorant Agent & Weapon Stats

Spike Stats offers detailed performance tracking for both **agents** and **weapons**, helping you understand your strengths, optimize your playstyle, and improve over time. All stats are segmented by game mode and can be easily sorted, filtered, and shared.

## Agent Stats

Spike Stats tracks your match performance across all agents you've played — broken down by game mode for clarity and depth.

### Game Mode Segmentation

Agent stats are grouped by game modes. Within each tab, you'll see the agents you've played in that mode.

### Key Metrics per Agent

For each agent, you'll see:

- Score per Round

Tapping on an agent opens a **detailed view**, including:
