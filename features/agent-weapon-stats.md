# Valorant Agent & Weapon Stats

Spike Stats offers detailed performance tracking for both **agents** and **weapons**, helping you understand your strengths, optimize your playstyle, and improve over time. All stats are segmented by game mode and can be easily sorted, filtered, and shared.

## Agent Stats

Spike Stats tracks your match performance across all agents you've played — broken down by game mode for clarity and depth.

### Game Mode Segmentation

Agent stats are grouped by game modes. Within each tab, you'll see the agents you've played in that mode.

### Key Metrics per Agent

For each agent, you'll see:
- Role (Duelist, Sentinel, Controller, Initiator)
- Win Rate
- KDA & K/D Ratio
- Score per Round

Tapping on an agent opens a **detailed view**, including:
- Win rate when starting as attacker vs. defender
- Average kills per round, damage per round, score per round
- Average ability casts per round

### Sorting & Filtering Options

You can sort your agent list by:
- Win Rate
- Kills
- K/D Ratio
- Score per Round
- Damage per Round

You can also filter agents by their **roles**, such as:
- Duelists
- Controllers
- Sentinels
- Initiators

### Shareable Agent Stats

Generate a **custom screenshot** of your sorted agent stats — perfect for sharing your performance with friends or on social media.

## Weapon Stats

Track your effectiveness with every weapon you've used across different game modes.

### Game Mode Segmentation

Just like Agent Stats, weapon stats are divided by game modes. Within each tab, you'll see the weapons you've used in that mode.

### Key Metrics per Weapon

For each weapon, you can view:
- Total kills
- Kills per round
- Damage per round

Tapping on a weapon reveals a **detailed shot breakdown**:
- Headshot percentage
- Body shot percentage
- Leg shot percentage

### Sorting & Filtering Options

Sort your weapons list by:
- Kills
- Kills per round
- Damage per round
- Shot percentages and more...

Filter weapons by their **type**, such as:
- Sidearms
- Rifles
- SMGs
- Snipers
- Shotguns
- Heavy weapons

### Shareable Weapon Stats

Create a **custom stats screenshot** for your weapon performance to share your top picks and accuracy highlights.
