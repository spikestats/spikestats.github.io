# Valorant Coach – Your AI-Powered Assistant for Game Improvement

Spike Stats includes a powerful built-in **AI Valorant Coach** designed to help you review your gameplay, analyze your performance trends, and improve your skills through intelligent, personalized feedback.

Whether you're looking to refine your agent playstyle, improve weapon usage, or get coaching for a specific match, the Valorant Coach has you covered.

## Personalized Insights Through Smart Prompts

The Valorant Coach is available in **two powerful modes** to suit your needs:

---

## 1. Standalone Coach Assistant

Use the Coach like a personal gaming analyst — ask it for advice across your full stats history. Just type a question or select from available smart prompts:

### Available Prompts:
- *Analyze my matches*
- *Analyze my recent performance trends*
- *Inspect my agent performance*
- *Review my weapon performance*
- *Compare my stats to another player*
- *Define Valorant terms*

Once you receive an answer, Spike Stats suggests **additional, deeper prompts** to dig further into your gameplay.

### Example Follow-up Prompts:
- *Analyze in detail*
- *How do my stats compare to others?*
- *Am I making enough impact as a teammate?*
- *Am I playing too aggressively or too defensively?*
- *What can I do to reduce unnecessary deaths?* and many, many more...

This interactive flow makes coaching feel intuitive, personalized, and player-focused.

## 2. Match-Specific Coaching

You can also use the Valorant Coach from within any **Match Details page**, where it will analyze that exact match in-depth.

### Match-Based Prompts Include:
- *Analyze my match performance*
- *How consistent was my performance across rounds?*
- *How effective were my weapon choices?*
- *Were my decisions effective in key rounds?*
- *Did I have more impact on attack or defense?*
- *Did I significantly influence this match's outcome?*
- *How did my stats compare to others in the match?*
- *How well did I perform against higher-ranked opponents?*
- *Which teammates contributed the most to our result?*
- *How can I improve in future matches?*

These prompts provide actionable insights to help you understand not just **what** happened in a match — but **why** it happened and **how to improve**.
