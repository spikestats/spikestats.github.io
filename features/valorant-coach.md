## Personalized Insights Through Smart Prompts

The Valorant Coach is available in **two powerful modes** to suit your needs:

---

## 1. Standalone Coach Assistant

Use the Coach like a personal gaming analyst — ask it for advice across your full stats history. Just type a question or select from available smart prompts:

### Available Prompts:
- *Analyze my matches*
- *Analyze my recent performance trends*
- *Inspect my agent performance*
- *Review my weapon performance*
- *Compare my stats to another player*
- *Define Valorant terms*

Once you receive an answer, Spike Stats suggests **additional, deeper prompts** to dig further into your gameplay.

### Example Follow-up Prompts:
- *Analyze in detail*
- *How do my stats compare to others?*
- *Am I making enough impact as a teammate?*
- *Am I playing too aggressively or too defensively?*
- *What can I do to reduce unnecessary deaths?* and many, many more...

This interactive flow makes coaching feel intuitive, personalized, and player-focused.

## 2. Match-Specific Coaching

You can also use the Valorant Coach from within any **Match Details page**, where it will analyze that exact match in-depth.

### Match-Based Prompts Include:
- *Analyze my match performance*
- *How consistent was my performance across rounds?*
- *How effective were my weapon choices?*
- *Were my decisions effective in key rounds?*
- *Did I have more impact on attack or defense?*
- *Did I significantly influence this match's outcome?*
- *How did my stats compare to others in the match?*
- *How well did I perform against higher-ranked opponents?*
- *Which teammates contributed the most to our result?*
- *How can I improve in future matches?*

These prompts provide actionable insights to help you understand not just **what** happened in a match — but **why** it happened and **how to improve**.
