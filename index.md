### Performance Graphs

It utilizes and interprets the data in the API to create insightful new information such as performance averages and trends. This data is then displayed to players in the form of beautiful graphs that are simple to digest.

### Minimalistic UI

Spike Stats is inspired by the minimalistic UI of Valorant and takes design cues from it to recreate the look and feel of the game while adding some characteristic elements of its own.
